# EV Basics using MATLAB Simulink

This repository contains basic Electric Vehicle (EV) simulations
developed using MATLAB and Simulink for academic laboratory
and beginner learning purposes.

The repository is structured into:
- Battery and Battery Management Systems
- Power Electronics for EVs
- Electric Machines and Drives

Some simulations are preliminary academic models and may be
refined or validated further over time.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (R2022a or later recommended)
- Simulink
- Simscape Electrical OR Specialized Power Systems

# Disclaimer
These models are for educational use only and are not intended
for commercial or safety-critical EV design.
