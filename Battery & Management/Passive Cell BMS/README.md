# Project Overview

## Objective
Briefly describe what this simulation demonstrates in the context of EV systems.

## Concepts Covered
- Key electrical / EV concepts involved
- System behavior under basic conditions

## Tools Required
- MATLAB
- Simulink
- Simscape Electrical (if applicable) OR Specialized Power Systems

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Open the Simulink model (`.slx`)
4. Click **Run**
5. Observe scopes and outputs

## Expected Behavior
Describe what the user should roughly observe
(voltage trends, speed response, SOC change, etc.).

## Status
Draft / Under Review

## Notes
This model is intended for academic learning and
may be simplified or refined in future updates.
